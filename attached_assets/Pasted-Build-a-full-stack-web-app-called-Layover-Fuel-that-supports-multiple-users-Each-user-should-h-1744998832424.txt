Build a full-stack web app called "Layover Fuel" that supports multiple users.

Each user should have their own profile with secure login and a conversational AI onboarding experience. Instead of a static form, use a GPT-style large language model (LLM) interaction to simulate a human-like fitness/health coach that gathers the following info:
- Name, email, age, height, weight, gender
- Fitness goal: Shred (fat loss) or Sustain (maintenance/muscle retention)
- Activity level (lightly active, moderate, very active)
- Any dietary restrictions (e.g., no dairy, vegetarian)
- Gym memberships (e.g., YMCA, Planet Fitness, etc.)
- Max distance willing to travel to gym (walking or public transit)

The app should calculate a custom TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) for each user and generate a personalized daily plan with:
- Macro-balanced meal suggestions
- Hotel/room workout plan plus gym recommendations based on gym access and proximity
- Daily motivation or mindset tip based on their goal and energy level

The app must include:
- A dashboard showing current progress and trends (weight, steps, HRV if connected to Apple Health or via manual entry)
- Structured data tracking for Nutrition, Workout, and Health using Airtable (or fallback to local storage)
- A backend logic layer that uses GPT (via OpenAI API) to generate plans and adjust macros weekly
- A way to store data in Airtable, with one row per user per day, per log type
- Built-in notifications (daily check-ins, stretch reminders, flex meal alerts)
- An AI feedback loop that asks the user “How was today?” and refines future plans based on their answers

Use Python (FastAPI or Flask) for the backend and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a frontend framework (like React or Svelte). Structure the project cleanly and use comments to guide future development.

Include this Airtable schema:
