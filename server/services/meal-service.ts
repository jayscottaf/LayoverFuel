      Create a full day's meal plan with:
      1. Breakfast (easy to get in hotels)
      2. Lunch (nearby restaurant option)
      3. Dinner (nearby restaurant option)
      4. 1-2 Snacks
      
      For each meal, include:
      - Name
      - Brief description focused on easily accessible/packable foods while traveling
      - Macros (protein, carbs, fat, calories)
      - For lunch and dinner, include a typical restaurant name and approximate distance ("nearby")
      
      Make sure the entire day's meals add up close to the target macros.
      Assume the person has limited cooking capability (hotel room).
